## Development History

### Project Initialization
- **Status**: Completed
- **Description**: Initial project setup and documentation
- **Key Deliverables**:
  - README.md updated to match product specification
  - Project structure documentation
  - Development planning documents created
  - Product specification v0 finalized

## Lessons Learned

### Template Structure Issues
- **Issue**: Templates using separate `{% block sidebar %}` conflicted with base template layout
- **Solution**: Restructure templates to use only `{% block content %}` with Bootstrap grid system
- **Impact**: Fixed blank page issues in story CRUD operations
- **Prevention**: Always check base template structure before creating new templates

### Database Schema Evolution
- **Issue**: AdminLog model missing fields for story-related actions
- **Solution**: Added `target_story_id`, `target_event_id`, `target_topic_id` columns
- **Impact**: Enabled proper admin logging for all CRUD operations
- **Prevention**: Plan for extensibility when designing initial models

### Import System Design
- **Success**: Comprehensive CSV import with deduplication worked well
- **Key Features**: Column mapping, validation, source extraction, progress tracking
- **Impact**: Enabled bulk data import with minimal user friction
- **Replication**: Use similar pattern for future bulk operations

### CRUD Operations Pattern
- **Success**: Consistent pattern for admin CRUD operations
- **Components**: Routes, templates, JavaScript, validation, logging
- **Impact**: Fast development of story management system
- **Replication**: Use same pattern for topics, threads, events

## Archive Notes

This document will be updated as development progresses. Initially, it will track granular commit-level details, but as features are completed and tested, the granular details will be condensed into higher-level summaries to keep the document manageable.

### Archive Strategy
- **Active Development**: Track individual commits and detailed progress
- **Recently Completed**: Keep detailed commit history for 1-2 sprints
- **Completed Features**: Summarize into feature-level accomplishments
- **Completed Milestones**: High-level summary of major achievements

### Condensation Rules
- After a feature is completed and tested, condense individual commits into feature summary
- After a milestone is completed, condense feature summaries into milestone summary
- Keep only the most important technical decisions and lessons learned
- Archive detailed commit logs to git history only

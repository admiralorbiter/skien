## Archive Notes

This document will be updated as development progresses. Initially, it will track granular commit-level details, but as features are completed and tested, the granular details will be condensed into higher-level summaries to keep the document manageable.

### Archive Strategy
- **Active Development**: Track individual commits and detailed progress
- **Recently Completed**: Keep detailed commit history for 1-2 sprints
- **Completed Features**: Summarize into feature-level accomplishments
- **Completed Milestones**: High-level summary of major achievements

### Condensation Rules
- After a feature is completed and tested, condense individual commits into feature summary
- After a milestone is completed, condense feature summaries into milestone summary
- Keep only the most important technical decisions and lessons learned
- Archive detailed commit logs to git history only

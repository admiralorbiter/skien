## Development Notes

### Current Architecture Decisions
- Using SQLAlchemy ORM for database operations
- Flask-Migrate (Alembic) for database migrations
- Pytest for testing framework
- Following the existing Flask app structure with blueprints

### Technical Debt to Address
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling to models
- [ ] Implement proper logging throughout the application
- [ ] Add input validation and sanitization
- [ ] Create database connection pooling for production
- [ ] Fix SQLAlchemy relationship warnings (overlaps parameters)
- [ ] Add CSRF protection to forms
- [ ] Implement proper error pages (404, 500)
- [ ] Add database migration system for production

### Performance Considerations
- [ ] Add database indexes for frequently queried fields
- [ ] Consider pagination for large result sets
- [ ] Plan for lazy loading of relationships
- [ ] Monitor memory usage with large datasets

## Testing Strategy

### Current Testing Focus
- [x] Unit tests for all model classes (basic tests implemented)
- [ ] Integration tests for database operations (in progress)
- [x] Validation tests for data constraints (implemented)
- [ ] Migration tests for database schema changes

### Test Coverage Goals
- Aim for 80%+ code coverage on models
- Test all validation rules and constraints
- Test all relationship operations
- Test error handling scenarios

## Next Sprint Planning

### Potential Next Sprint: Import System
- CSV file upload handling
- Column mapping interface
- Data validation and preview
- Batch import processing
- Deduplication logic

### Dependencies for Next Sprint
- Complete all database models
- Set up proper error handling
- Create test data fixtures
- Implement basic CRUD operations

## Questions & Decisions Needed

### Technical Decisions
- [ ] Should we use UUIDs or auto-incrementing integers for primary keys?
- [ ] How should we handle timezone information for dates?
- [ ] What validation library should we use for complex validations?
- [ ] Should we implement soft deletes or hard deletes?

### Product Decisions
- [ ] What should be the default importance levels for events?
- [ ] How should we handle edge cases in date parsing?
- [ ] What should be the maximum length for text fields?
- [ ] How should we handle duplicate tag names?
